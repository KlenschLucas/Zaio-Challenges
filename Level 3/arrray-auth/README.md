Build a signup form that takes in the details such as Name,Surname, Age, Email,Password, confirm password and then 
stores the values in an array only if both the passwords match and shows a JS alert that says success once the submit
 button is pressed or else it shows a JS alert saying the passwords do not match. Feel free to use resources on the 
 internet. Feel free to add your own styling (css & bootstraps). Your Array Structure: `[‘Name’,’Surname’,’Age’,’Email’,
 'Password’,’Confirm Password’]`
