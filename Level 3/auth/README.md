Klensch Lucas

### Note
Two of the challenges for Level 3 have been combined namely *Authentication System* and *Profile of the User* due to it
having overlapping areas. 

## Description
### Authentication System
Create an Auth System that uses a simple html forms as the UI. You will be need to make 2 html pages, one for sign in
and one for sign up. Design your own database architecture to store the sign up details in the database. The user should
be able to sign in after they have signed up. When the user signs up the user should be notified ‘You have signed up’.
When the user signs in, the user should be notified ‘You have signed in’. You may only use the programming language or
framework you chose as your Specialisation to attempt this challenge. There is no correct answer for this, brain storm
and just make what you think is right.

### Profile of the User
Create a sign in system when the user can edit his profile and save it and then log out. Assume the user is a student,
he should be able to change his name, surname ,age, degree and his favourite course. You may only use the programming
language or frame that you chose for your specialisation. There is no correct answer for this, do what you feel is right
and think, do what you feel is right.
